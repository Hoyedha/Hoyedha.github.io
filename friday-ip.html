      <h2>About Me</h2>

          <p>My name is Sally Ndegwa and i school at Makini High School.I have done an intern at Eagle Africa insurance company.
           I wanted to start programming because i beliave that coding is the next language that will be incorporated into the
           the world and everyone will have to understand it otherwise they will be deemed illiterate and not well educated therefore
           lack of employment that will lead to low standards of living and thats why i decided to start learning how to program at a
           the ripe age of 15 in order to be a pioneer at my school and moringaschool has helped me to learn how to do something that
           is fun and value adding.</p>

           <p>One of my hobbies is playing video games.I can play hours on end.I would someday want to learn how to make my own game.
             Another hobby that i enjoy is playing football.I have been playing football for over 10 years!I would like to play abroad
             and always flew out of the country when we have a trip for football.I remember seeing the amazing stadium in Spain of Real
             Madrid by the name Estadio De Bernabeu.It just so happens that Real Madrid is my favourite team.</div>

           <div class="text-box">One of skills is being able to understand and pick up content quickly and remember for a long time be able to teach others.
             Another one of my skills is gaming.No one can beat me in gaming if you think you can, send me an invite to either a fifa match
             nba or call of duty.</div>
